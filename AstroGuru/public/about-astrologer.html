				Mrs. Sandhya Awasthi has been a Science Graduate and did her Honours 
				Degree from Jiwaji University. She has given various programmes on 
				Astrology in TV <br>
				<br>
				She is a strong believer that the actions of our previous lives 
				determine the present. Every event of the present life which is 
				beyond our control is predetermined. <br>
				<br>
				A good environment at work, a good work place, a good doer and 
				all the resources and efforts of doer are if not able to perform 
				a work, then only the ‘Fate’ is the reason for non-completion 
				and failure. – 18/11/42 Shloka of Bhagwat Geeta. <br>
				<br>
				Can any astrological remedy change the course of events? She 
				says, Yes, to a great extent, but only where the right remedy is 
				given which may be either Mantra or Pujas or Gemstones. She 
				strongly believes that there are only two things that exist in 
				the whole universe and that are namely 1) vibration/sound and 2) 
				energy, which is scientifically true also. Mantras are nothing 
				but vibrations of different kinds and Gemstones provide cosmic 
				energy through their divine rays which is required by an 
				individual.<br>
				<br>
				She spent many years in detailed research and study of Astronomy, 
				Astrology, Numerology, Gem-therapy, and Mantras etc. His sole 
				motto was to solve the problems being faced by the people in 
				different walks of life. To quote a few such as, that the girl’s 
				family is very rich but marriage is not taking place, an 
				advocate not able to solve his own problem, a doctor not able to 
				treat his own child, etc. Since the age of around 30 she started 
				providing astro-consultations solving the problems with 
				innumerable correct prediction.<br>
				<br>
				During the last 18 years he has gone through thousands of 
				horoscopes and has imparted astrological consultations to 
				foreigners, NRI people and locals in India also. She has deep 
				studies of this subject and has great expertise over various 
				matters such as Health, Money, Shares and Investments, Travels, 
				Education, Progeny, Litigation, Business and Corporate Matters, 
				Longevity, Career, Marriage and related matters viz. Romance and 
				Divorce. etc. <br>
